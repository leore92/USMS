USMS - Ultra Simple Minified Script
Overview
USMS, short for Ultra Simple Minified Script, is a programming language designed for simplicity and versatility. It provides a straightforward and concise way to write code, making it accessible to developers of all levels. With only 50 essential commands and a focus on minimalism, USMS aims to streamline the coding process while delivering powerful results.

How It Works
USMS code is made up of a series of commands, each consisting of 3 to 5 uppercase characters. These commands cover a wide range of functionalities, from basic mathematics to user interactions and HTML/CSS manipulation. The language's simplicity allows developers to create programs quickly and efficiently.

Key Features
Simplicity: USMS keeps the syntax minimal, making it easy to read and write code.
Versatility: With a limited set of commands, USMS can handle various tasks, from mathematical calculations to web interactions.
Web Integration: USMS is designed to work seamlessly with web technologies, including HTML and CSS.
Unique Aspects

Web Interpreter
As a single-person developer, I'm currently working on a web-based interpreter for USMS.
This interpreter will allow you to write and execute USMS code directly in your web browser.
It will feature an input field for writing code and an output field to see the results.
The interpreter is an ongoing project, and I'm continuously working on improving its functionality and user experience.
